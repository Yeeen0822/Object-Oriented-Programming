 The main idea of this assignment is to create an easy and user-friendly product launch event
 management system. In this event management system, there will be two user interfaces, which are
 for the administrator and participants.
 When there are organizers who wish to launch their products, they can come to our office and book an
 event with our administrator. The organizer has to fill out all the details on a printed event booking
 paper form. Information like the organizer’s details and the event’s details are required. Then, the
 organizer will submit the form to the administrator so that the administrator can key in the information
 on the paper form into our system. Next, the organizer has to make payment after making a booking,
 whether it is straight after the booking or the next day. Moreover, we charge for the event based on the
 venue, the decoration of the event, the number of products to be launched, the number of promoters
 and some others. Every booking has a payment status stating whether it is paid, pending, or canceled.
 Furthermore, the event’s details are allowed to be updated if the organizer wishes to make some
 changes. If the organizer wishes to cancel the paid event booking, only 50% of the event fee will be
 refunded in 3 working days. The organizer can only place a booking that is at least 15 days in
 advance.
 On the other hand, we also assume the participant would use the kiosk to do registration for the
 particular event on the event day. The events whose payment status is “paid” will only be shown to
 the participants. The participants are required to fill out their personal information and choose which
 event to participate in. Moreover, they have to pay for the event registration fee, where the price of
 each VIP seat is RM500 while the normal seat is RM350. Moreover, our business rule is that there is
 no refund or cancellation of event registration. Hence, if the participant has filled out their information
 but does not make payment successfully, the registration is considered failed. Besides, our other
 business rule is that only one ticket can be purchased by each participant, which means there is no
 option for the quantity of tickets available. This is important as we may want to track the participant’s
 information in order to do analytics and reports so that we can make data-driven decisions in the
 future.
 On top of that, administrators will need to log in to the system by entering their administrator ID and
 password in order to do some administrative tasks. There are 3 administrative tasks: admin profile
 management, event management, and analytics and reports. We assume that there is an administrator
 manager who can have some privileges, like registering a new administrator and viewing all
 administrator’s profiles. Every administrator will be assigned an administrator ID, which they must
 remember in order to log in to their account. In case the administrators forgot their password, we
 allow them to change it by asking for their administrator ID and IC for verification.
 In the Analytics and Report screen, administrators can view all the reports, such as booking statistics,
 event registration reports, total revenue, location-based analytics, cancellation analytics, and payment
 analytics. the total number of participants that came to an event. In the booking statistics screen, the
 admin will be able to see the live statistics of how many phone and car events there are and also the
 percentage of each event. Meanwhile, in the event registration report, the admin will be able to view
 the total registrations regardless of which event, and also the number of registrations for each event. In
 the revenue screen, the admin will see the current revenue. To continue, the admin will be able to view
 the total events that take place or take place at each event venue in the location-based analytics. The
 admin will also be able to see the number of canceled bookings on the cancellation analytic screen.
 Lastly, in the payment analytics, the admin will get to see how many bookings are paid with cash and
 card and also in percentage
